# Road to Permissionless

Flow is on track to enable permissionless smart contract deployment **this summer**. Permissionless smart contract deployment is a critical milestone in Flow’s journey of [increasing decentralization over time](https://www.notboring.co/p/flow-the-normie-blockchain?s=r). 

## Why is it important?

### More builders
Developers building on Flow will be able to autonomously deploy and upgrade their smart contracts. Permissionless smart contract deployment will attract new developers and more applications and services being built on Flow – whether net new, or composed on top of existing applications – enriching the Flow ecosystem as a whole.

### More security
To enable this important milestone, [Cadence](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence/), Flow's native smart contract programming language, has been undergoing[  rigorous audits and improvements](https://forum.onflow.org/t/breaking-changes-coming-with-secure-cadence-release/3052), split in 2 phases: Secure Cadence, and Stable Cadence.
- **Secure Cadence**: focused on code-hardening and will enable the permissionless deployment of smart contracts on Mainnet. 
- **Stable Cadence**: a future update that will focus on usability improvements (not required for permissionless smart contract deployment)

### More opportunities
Permissionless smart contract deployment is only one of many ways that the Flow ecosystem is growing and enabling opportunities. For example, Flow's [$750M Ecosystem Fund](https://flow.com/ecosystemsupport) is the largest joint commitment made towards any blockchain ecosystem. Join a vibrant and growing community building the future of Web3.

# How does this affect me? 

## I am a _developer_

There may be actions required - this depends if you have already deployed a smart contract on testnet or mainnet.

### I already deployed a smart contract on _testnet_ and/or _mainnet_

#### Immediate actions 

- [ ] Review the upcoming changes and test your contracts for breaking changes: [here](https://forum.onflow.org/t/breaking-changes-coming-with-secure-cadence-release/3052)
- [ ] Mark June 8th, 2022 as an important date on your calendar: this is when breaking changes will be deployed to **testnet**
- [ ] Mark June 15th, 2022 as an important date on your calendar: this is when breaking changes will be deployed to **mainnet**

#### Recommended actions

- [ ] Download and use the Secure Cadence breaking changes analyzer: 
- [ ] Participate in the Secure Cadence Bug Bounty: https://forum.onflow.org/t/help-us-test-secure-cadence-release-candidate/3112


### If you have not deployed a smart contract on testnet or mainnet

Then no immediate or time-sensitive action is required from you. Just make sure you are aware of the changes that are coming to Cadence and of the critical dates where these breaking changes will be live (June 8th on testnet, June 15th on mainnet). More on that [here](https://forum.onflow.org/t/breaking-changes-coming-with-secure-cadence-release/3052)


### I am a _node operator_

On **June 15th**, Flow mainnet will undergo a scheduled spork. Follow the regular Spork process as outlined [here](https://docs.onflow.org/node-operation/spork/). Please ensure a timely upgrade and tight communication with the rest of the network.

### I am not a developer, but I am interested in Flow

Good news! No action is required from you. You should know that this is a critical protocol milestone for Flow's journey towards making Flow [increasingly decentralized](https://www.notboring.co/p/flow-the-normie-blockchain?s=r). See the "Why is this important" section above for more information.
