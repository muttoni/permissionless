## Developers

Some timelines above may require action from you. This depends if you have already deployed a smart contract on testnet or mainnet, or not. 

### If you have already deployed a smart contract on testnet or mainnet

#### Immediate actions 
- Review the upcoming changes and test your contracts for breaking changes: [here](https://forum.onflow.org/t/breaking-changes-coming-with-secure-cadence-release/3052)
- Mark June 8th, 2022 as an important date on your calendar: this is when breaking changes will be deployed to **testnet**
- Mark June 15th, 2022 as an important date on your calendar: this is when breaking changes will be deployed to **mainnet**

- Participate in the Secure Cadence Bug Bounty: https://forum.onflow.org/t/help-us-test-secure-cadence-release-candidate/3112


### If you have not deployed a smart contract on testnet or mainnet

Then no immediate or time-sensitive action is required from you. Just make sure you are aware of the changes that are coming to Cadence and of the critical dates where these breaking changes will be live (June 8th on testnet, June 15th on mainnet).
